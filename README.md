MovieBase
=========

Final project for Data Structures class.

MovieBase classes and client/driver file written by me. Most of the
userbase classes written by my project partner Rob Rymarcyzk.

What it does (loosely based on Netflix recommendation challenge):
    - reads files of movies, reviews, and users and builds a MovieBase
      structure to hold the Movie object, and a UserBase structure to hold
      the User objects.
    - does some calculations, finds a list of recommended movies for a user,
      based on that user's previous movie reviews
